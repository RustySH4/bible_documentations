# Welcome to the hardware documentation part

This section is dedicate to the documentation of the processor SH7305 which don't
have public data sheet. My objective, with other people like [__Lephenixnoir__][1] and
[__Simon Lothar__][2], is to create public, free and reliable documentation of all
processor's modules and have fun with it ^^

We don't care to known how the OS work but some modules is absolutely not documented,
so we don't have any choice that reverse-engineering Casio's syscalls to find information.
Any touchy, information will be not reveled because we don't want any problems with Casio.
