# Welcome to the Yatis bible's part !

In this section of the Planet Casio's Bible, you will find some informations and
notes that I gleaned during my nights of reverse engineering of the Casio's OS :D

This place is divided in two major parts.

The first part is reserved to the [__hardware documentation__][1] of the SH7305.
You will find (generally) information about Casio's protocol to handle module
interruptions, module power-on, module power-off and the bit masks of modules
registers.

The second part is reserved to the [__software documentation__][2], mainly notes
about syscalls and Casio's kernel information.
