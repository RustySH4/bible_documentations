# G3A addin file format documentation

All this file is based on [this page][1], written by Simon Lothar.<br>
More explication will be delivered when I will have disassembled some syscalls
used to check the addin file format.

## G3A header (offset 0x000 to 0x020)

All file formats that are read or written by the calculator share a common header format.<br>
This header is inverted (ex: 0x01 -> 0xfe) before being written and read, so a
description of the inverted file data make more sense than the normal file data:

| Offset | Size (byte) | Description                                                |
|--------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x0000 | 8           | File Identifier: "USBPower"                                |
| 0x0008 | 1           | File Type (see below)                                      |
| 0x0009 | 5           | Control bytes: {0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x01, 0x00}              |
| 0x000E | 1           | Control byte: LSB of filesize + 0x41                       |
| 0x000F | 1           | Control byte: 0x01                                         |
| 0x0010 | 4           | Total file size as unsigned integer, big endian format     |
| 0x0014 | 1           | Control byte: LSB of filesize + 0xB8                       |
| 0x0015 | 1           | Unknown purpose, appears insignificant                     |
| 0x0016 | 2           | Checksum of 8 words starting at offset 0x7100              |
| 0x0018 | 8           | Unknown purpose, appears insignificant                     |

<u>offset 0x008:</u><br>
Known file type:
* 0x2C = Add-in
* 0x49 = eAct
* 0x7d = Picture Plot File

<u>offset 0x00E</u><br>
The LSB of filesize is stored at offset 0x013<br>

<u>offset 0x010</u><br>
Total file size = (header size + subheader size + last hecksum) + add-in code size<br>
Total file size = (0x7004) + addin code size<br>

<u>offset 0x014</u><br>
The LSB of filesize is stored at offset 0x013<br>

<u>offset 0x016</u><br>
Checked only by the CASIO fx-9860 SDK emulator.

## Note (Simon Lothar):

Upon execution, the addin-code starting at file offset 0x7000 is virtually mapped
to 0x00300000, and the OS jumps to address 0x00300000 (Addin code). The addin code
should use 0x08100000 for its .bss and .data sections (static RAM). CASIOs SDK
will automatically add initialization code that loads the .data section and
performs various system calls.

G3A-startup; fx-CG20; OS1.04
syscall sys0017 App_RegisterAddins_ validates add-ins, when the MAIN MENU is built up.
1. the checksums at 0x20 and at the end of the file are compared (0x8002D376; OS104).
2. the byte at 0x24 is checked to be 1 (0x8002D386; OS104).

The byte at 0x0E is not checked.
The byte at 0x14 is not checked.
With OS 1.04, the complete 0x10 bytes starting at 0x00 are not heeded for.

When the addin is started, the following checks are done inside of 0x8002CB22 (OS104),
called by syscall 0x0026 and 0x002C. 0x002C seems to check conv.g3a every time
any addin is started. At first the actual filesize is compared to the filesize
stored at file-offset 0x5C (0x8002CB94; OS104). Then it calculates and compares
the checksum (0x8002CCBE; OS104).

Two address-ranges 0xFE240000 and 0xFE241000 are involved in addin-loading.
They contain at least 63 int-values, which are initialized with zeros.
* If an addin is considered to be OK the correspondig entry in table 0xFE240000 is 1.
* If a checksum-mismatch or a filesize-mismatch is detected, the corressponding
value in table 0xFE240000 will be 2. These memory-ranges are a bit peculiar.

The calculator freezes, if INSIGHT tries to display the memory-ranges. Theses addresses obviously are not used in the GII-2 series' OSes.
